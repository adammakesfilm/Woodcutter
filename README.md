# Woodcutter

This datapack is a crafting tweak that allows you to use the stonecutter to craft various wood blocks. The datapack is intended to be used in conjunction with the [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks) "More Stairs", "More Bark", and "More Trapdoors" datapacks because the output of the stonecutter is the same as the output of the modified recipies in the Vanilla Tweaks datapacks. If you aren't using them, you may want to modify the recipies in this datapack to use the vanilla recipies instead.

## Installation

1. Download the datapack from the [Releases page](https://github.com/VanillaTweaks/Woodcutter/releases).
2. Place the downloaded `.zip` file in your Minecraft's `datapacks` folder.
3. Enable the datapack by running the `/datapack enable "file/Woodcutter.zip"` command in-game.
